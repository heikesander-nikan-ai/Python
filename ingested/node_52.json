Key concepts extracted: hybrid neuro-symbolic systems.", "status": "Draft", "author": "User Master", "validator": "None", "title": "Neuro-symbolic systems fuse the adaptability of neural networks with the logical reasoning and interpretability of symbolic AI. Recent work systematically studies various architectures, such as Symbolic[Neuro], Neuro[Symbolic], and coroutine-based models, showing promise for domains requiring transparency and robust adaptation to changing rules or contexts. These models excel in tasks poorly addressed by pure neural approaches, providing both dynamic learning and explicit knowledge representation.[](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.11269v1)", "concepts": [], "relations": []}
